# CV Chatbot

This is an interactive chatbot built using LangChain, OpenAI embeddings, and Streamlit.  
It allows users to ask questions about my CV and receive conversational, context-aware answers.  

The chatbot processes my CV (Word document), creates vector embeddings for semantic search,  
and uses OpenAIâ€™s language model to generate detailed responses based on the document content.
